# Magento 2 AWB Generator

- Using this extension you can generate the AWB number for the Romanian Urgent-Cargus Courier directly from your Magento store. The extension will add button in your shipment details "Generate AWB Urgent". When you click on this button you will be redirected to a new page where you will find all the customer details and the data for the courier like price, insurance, total value. You will be able to edit most of the data here and then save. The approve button will send the data to the courier web services. If the AWB was created in the Urgent-Cargus client area you will get a success message, else you will see the error sent back by the web service. 

- The extension also has a configuration area. You can config the settings in that area.

- We developed this extension for our clients and then adapted the code to be able to be used by the Magento 2 community.
